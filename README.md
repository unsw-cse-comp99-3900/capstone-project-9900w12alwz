### Installation Manual

**1. Environment Configuration**

This project is Dockerized. Please follow these steps to configure and deploy the application:

**Environment Variable Configuration**:

1. **Create the `.env` File**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to hold your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference to configure your environment variables.

   ```text
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key. **Note**: Ensure that the `.env` file is not committed to version control. You can add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed.

   **Steps**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file to include your actual API key:
     ```text
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
